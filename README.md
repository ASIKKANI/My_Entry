# Blue Paper and White Ink
> *pixels of art and verses of consciousness*

Welcome to **Blue Paper and White Ink**, a sanctuary for your thoughts designed to feel less like a "tool" and more like a personal retreat. This isn't just a note-taking app; it's a space where your digital words feel as weighty and beautiful as ink on paper.

## ✨ The Experience

We built this because most writing apps feel cold and utilitarian. Blue Paper and White Ink is different.

- **Aesthetic First**: The interface is minimal, calm, and beautiful. From the animated entrance to the paper-like layouts, every pixel is crafted to help you focus.
- **Your Style, Your Font**: Why should your journal look like everyone else's?
    - **Title Styling**: Give your headlines a unique personality with distinct fonts.
    - **Body Typography**: Choose from over 15+ premium fonts, including elegant scripts like *Pinyon Script*, classics like *Cinzel*, or clean modern sans-serifs. The font picker even previews the text *in* the font, so you know exactly what you're getting.
- **Smart Writing Tools**: The editing toolbar stays out of your way. It auto-hides when you're writing and pops up only when you need it. It's smart enough to know if you're editing a Title or a Paragraph and offers you the right tools for the job.

## 🔒 Privacy & Peace of Mind

- **The Locker**: Some thoughts are just for you. We've built a secure **Notes Locker** where you can password-protect specific entries. They vanish from the main dashboard and stay safely encrypted behind your seamless "Change Password" flow.
- **Moods & Themes**: Set the vibe for each entry. Feeling *Calm*? The page turns a soft blue. *Joy*? A warm amber. Or pick your own custom color to match the emotion of the moment.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

For the tech-savvy, this project is built with a modern, robust stack:

- **React Quill**: The engine behind the rich text editing, highly customized for our unique needs.
